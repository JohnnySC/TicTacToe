# TicTacToe
TicTacToe game
This is a typical TicTacToe game written in Java for 2 players.

To play the game you need to copy both files: game.java and Cell.java.
Create a package and name it myprograms. In it create a new one and call it TicTacToe. 
Or you can just copy the files wherever you want, the only thing you need to change is the way to the files(package --your chosen path).

The game runs correctly(in console), but it is supposed to input cell codes(e.g. 11, 12, 13, 21 and so on till 33).
It is ok if your input is wrong. The game will not stop until one of the player won.

This is the first version of the game.
Some improvements are supposed to be added in the future.

Have fun!
